# three.ar.js API

## new THREE.ARView(vrDisplay, renderer)

Creates an ARView with a [VRDisplay] and a [THREE.WebGLRenderer]. Handles the pass through camera differences between ARCore and ARKit platforms, and renders the camera behind your scene.

### THREE.ARView#render()

Renders the pass through camera. Usually called on every frame in a render loop before rendering other objects in the scene.

## new THREE.ARReticle(vrDisplay, innerRadius, outerRadius, color, easing)

Creates a [THREE.Mesh] reticle to render via hit tests with the [VRDisplay].

### void THREE.ARReticle#update(x, y)

Performs a hit test at `x` and `y` normalized coordinates and lerps the reticle
to the position. Usually called every frame to perform a hit test and cause the reticle
to "trace" along surfaces for placing additional objects.

## new THREE.ARPerspectiveCamera(vrDisplay, fov, aspect, near, far)

A subclass of [THREE.PerspectiveCamera], used to create a perspective camera that matches
your device's perspective and keep the projection matrix in sync with a device. Use
this camera to render your three.js objects ontop of an AR see through camera. If a `vrDisplay`
is not provided, or not an AR-capable display, falls back to a regular [THREE.PerspectiveCamera]
with supplied values. Only the `projectionMatrix` is updated if using an AR-capable device,
and the `fov`, `aspect`, `near`, `far` properties are not applicable.

### void THREE.ARPerspectiveCamera#getProjectionMatrix()

If given a [VRDisplay] in constructor, generates the projection matrix from the API to match the native camera intrinsics. To use the cached projection matrix, just access the `projectionMatrix` property instead.

## new THREE.ARDebug(vrDisplay, scene?, config)

Creates an ARDebug panel to display hit and pose information. Use `getElement()` to return the element managed by the ARDebug panel to inject into your content. Optionally takes [THREE.Scene] `scene`, needed for rendering of planes via `showPlanes: true`.

`config` is defined with defaults as follows:

```js
config = {
  showPoseStatus: true,
  showLastHit: true,
  showPlanes: false,
};
```

### THREE.ARDebug#open()

Opens the ARDebug panel.

### THREE.ARDebug#close()

Closes the ARDebug panel.

### HTMLElement THREE.ARDebug#getElement()

Returns the HTMLElement for the debug panel to inject into the content.

## THREE.ARUtils

Not a constructor but an object storing several utility functions listed below.

### Promise<VRDisplay?> THREE.ARUtils.getARDevice()

Returns a promise that resolves to a [VRDisplay] with AR capabilities or null if
device is unsupported.

### boolean THREE.ARUtils.isARDisplay(vrDisplay)

Takes a [VRDisplay] instance and returns a boolean whether or not this is considered an AR display. Will most likely be featured-based in the future.

### boolean THREE.ARUtils.isTango(vrDisplay)

Takes a [VRDisplay] instance and returns a boolean whether or not this is a Tango-backed/ARCore Android device.

### boolean THREE.ARUtils.isARKit(vrDisplay)

Takes a [VRDisplay] instance and returns a boolean whether or not this is an ARKit-based iOS device.
### Promise<THREE.Mesh> THREE.ARUtils.loadPolyModel(objPath, mtlPath?)

Takes a path for an OBJ model and optionally a path for an MTL texture and returns a promise resolving to a [THREE.Mesh] loaded with the appropriate material. Can be used on downloaded models from [Poly].

### void THREE.ARUtils.placeObjectAtHit(object, hit, easing=1, applyOrientation=false)

Takes a [THREE.Object3D] and a [VRHit] object from a `VRDisplay.prototype.hitTest` call, and
positions, and optionally orients, the object to the hit's model matrix. Optionally can use
easing to lerp between the object's current transform to the hit's transform.

### void THREE.ARUtils.displayUnsupportedMessage()

Generates an element and injects into the DOM a message notifying the user that their browser does not support prototype AR features. See examples of common usage.
